# Local Coffee Shop Website
Project Overview

This project is part of my Portfolio of Evidence (POE) for web development. The aim is to design and build a website for a local coffee shop. The website will highlight the business, display its menu, share contact details, and include a Google Map showing the shop’s location.

The work is divided into three phases:

HTML structure.

CSS design.

JavaScript functionality.

This document covers Part 1 – Building the Foundation.

Pages Included

Home Page (index.html) – Welcome text and shop introduction.

About Us (about.html) – Story of the coffee shop.

Menu (menu.html) – A menu with coffee and food options, supported by pictures.

Contact (contact.html) – Address, phone number, email, and Google Map embed.
